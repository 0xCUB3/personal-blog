# My name is Christos Panagiotakopoulos

I'm a dedicated software craftsman with a 5-year experience in NodeJS. Currently, I'm mainly working with **Typescript**, and I'm also learning **Elixir** and I'm also interested in learning **Go**.

Parallely, I'm working as a **tech team leader** at [**Enneas**](https://enneas.gr), an Athens-based software company, focusing on applications of innovative technologies ranging from AR/VR to chatbots.

I'm currently finishing my CS studies at the [School of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) of the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/).

In my free time, I play greek rembetiko music on the guitar and administrate the [rembetiko.gr](https://rembetiko.gr) community.

From time to time you can read some of my thoughts, projects and ideas that I share on [my blog](/posts).
