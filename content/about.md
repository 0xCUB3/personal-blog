# My name is Christos Panagiotakopoulos

I'm a software engineer working with NodeJS, JS/TS and anything in-between. I live in Athens, Greece but I like to work from anywhere in the world.

I'm currently finishing my CS studies at the [School of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.ntua.gr) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://ntua.gr).

Parallely, I'm working as a **tech team leader** at [**Enneas**](https://enneas.gr), an Athens-based software company, focusing on applications of innovative technologies ranging from AR/VR to chatbots.

Although I specialize on web technologies, I'm also interested in systems engineering, C/C++ development and operating systems.

In my free time, I play greek rembetiko music on the guitar and administrate the [rembetiko.gr](https://rembetiko.gr) community.

From time to time you can read some of my thoughts, projects and ideas that I share on [my blog](/posts).
