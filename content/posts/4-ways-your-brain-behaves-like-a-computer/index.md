Although it's tempting to draw parallels between your brain and a computer, in reality those two computational machines are fundamentally different. The same computation on a computer produces the exact same results. In contrast, your brain might produce different results when it executes two equal operations.

But, there your brain exhibits some behaviours that by chance are similar to some computer characteristics. By understanding those behaviors, you can apply some basic techniques drawn by the world of computer science and boost your productivity.

## 1. Your brain's "CPU" has a limited amount of registers

For a moment, try to perform the calculation 1782 * 7865 

## 2. Your brain performs context switching

## 3. Your brain is single-threaded
